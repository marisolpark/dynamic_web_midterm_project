If you just aren't feeling up to a night out or can't bear to organize another group outing, then don't. Say no to that next invitation and tell everyone to have fun without you. There's nothing wrong with spending some time alone. In fact, it's healthy. It will help you get more centered and give everyone else a chance to miss you for a while!",

Your emotions are driving you to make hasty decisions that might not be in your best interests in the long run, so resist the urge to start something new. Later, you can start pushing yourself to be more bold, more emotional, whatever. That's always invigorating, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep yourself busy with your daily routine for now.",

You can't get involved with situations you're unsure of, and you can't be a hundred percent certain that what you fear is true. Just let things be for a while, and don't push too hard. You might think you're acting as a compassionate friend, but they might think you're meddling in their life too much.",

People who have a lot of power over your life will be reviewing your work, and you want make to make sure that they like what they see. It won't be difficult at all to impress them, but you'll have to double-check your work just in case. Your relationship with these people is good, but you can't take anything for granted.",

You take them with you wherever you go, and they'll always be a part of you. Try to switch from sadness to gratitude that you got to know them in the first place. Your feelings are important to honor, but you can't let them control your goals in life. You can start to move again in a new direction.",

It probably isn't coming any time soon, in part because the other person or people involved are nowhere near admitting to the extent of the role they've played in it. Instead of wondering what you can do to affect the actions of other people (which is nothing, really), focus on yourself. Have a "me" day soon and do only things that you want to do.`,

It's good to challenge yourself, but do you really have to think in such grand terms? Be more modest in your aims. Instead of being rich by a certain age, just set a realistic goal to save a certain amount of money each month. That's something you can accomplish and something that will make your ego healthier.",
