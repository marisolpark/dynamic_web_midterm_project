If you just aren't feeling up to a night out or can't bear to organize another group outing, then don't. Say no to that next invitation and tell everyone to have fun without you. There's nothing wrong with spending some time alone. In fact, it's healthy. It will help you get more centered and give everyone else a chance to miss you for a while!",
        "love": "You will find yourself opening yourself up emotionally to others. It would be a great time to hold a virtual party or just invite a small group of friends around for a get-together, if possible. It would also be a good time to start communicating with some new people. Love thrives in new conditions and with people who are original and refreshingly unembarrassed about themselves.",

Your emotions are driving you to make hasty decisions that might not be in your best interests in the long run, so resist the urge to start something new. Later, you can start pushing yourself to be more bold, more emotional, whatever. That's always invigorating, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep yourself busy with your daily routine for now.",
        "love": "You will be consumed with the desire to explore on a social level. You could make the decision to attend a small party that you may have previously thought about avoiding. Love may be found in precisely whatever kinds of social situations are possible to participate in, and not by staying around in the same circles of people. And anyway, you need someone else to listen to your old jokes.",

You can't get involved with situations you're unsure of, and you can't be a hundred percent certain that what you fear is true. Just let things be for a while, and don't push too hard. You might think you're acting as a compassionate friend, but they might think you're meddling in their life too much.",

The love you are seeking is gradually drawing closer.",

You take them with you wherever you go, and they'll always be a part of you. Try to switch from sadness to gratitude that you got to know them in the first place. Your feelings are important to honor, but you can't let them control your goals in life. You can start to move again in a new direction.",

It probably isn't coming any time soon, in part because the other person or people involved are nowhere near admitting to the extent of the role they've played in it.
